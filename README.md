Kotlin Koans Solutions
===========

Kotlin Koans Workshop is a series of exercises to get you familiar with the Kotlin Syntax. 
Each exercise is created as a failing unit test and your job is to make it pass. 

This is my answers to all the exercices. They are 'my' way to do it. All tests are OK (93/93).
I've tried to focus on the inline expression and avoid 'java like' code. (That's the implicit objective after all)
